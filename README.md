**Muroidea**
========

<i>Background</i>
=

Muroidea was designed for a third year college and was well received and we were given an A. Simply put, it is
a network administration application written in C#.

<i>About</i>
=====

This program for this project is a Remote Administration Tool for Windows Operating Systems which 
will allow System Administrators to effectively track down anomalies in computers across a large 
computer network.
The application is split into two programs: a server application which will run on the administratorâ€™s 
computer and client services which will run on client machines.
 The client machines will send system information such as CPU, RAM, IO, network traffic, process list 
and machine uptime to the server and the server machine will analyse and report on these too see if 
they are within normal operating measures.



<i>Compiling Muroidea</i>
==================

Compiling Muroidea is relativily straightforward. Firstly, you should compile Communication, then Server and finally
Client.

<i>Installing</i>
==========

To install a clean version of the Muroidea system, simply run the Server program. Allow the server to start up , and
after a few moments it should be properly initialized. Then, run the Client program on all computers you would like to
control.
